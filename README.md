This repository has multiple clients, all of which can work indpendently.

With the protocol based on json, we are planning to implement the cliens:

- jclient/cs

- jclient/js

js client API depending on jquery.

Of which the jclient/js/easyui can basically working, providing the semantic-jsample server running.

Then open jclient/js/test/easyui/login.html.
